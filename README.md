# Userscripts

My personal must-have scripts are currently (2025-06-15) these:

This removes the timestamp from YouTube URLs (clicking on a history entry adds this), after loading. That way, you don't lose your place in a video, when you reload the page for some reason.

This forces the quality for Music Videos on YouTube Music to the highest quality available, which is usually 720p.

This sets the default quality for YouTube embeds to 4k or maximum available quality.

This makes the sidebar be toggable on Reddit, also sets a max width for the sidebar to prevent it from being too wide.

This makes the volume slider on HTML5 audio elements use a ratio instead of a linear scale, which allows for more precise volume control. I hate that this is not the default behavior.
The credit for this script goes to the Marco Pfeiffer, I just added a different match URL to it.

This makes Page Up and Page Down scroll half a page instead of a full page, which is useful for reading long articles.
